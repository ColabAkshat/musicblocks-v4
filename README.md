The core of the new Music Blocks 2 application.

## Contributing

Programmers, please follow these general
[guidelines for contributions](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md).

### New Contributors

Use the [discussions](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/discussions) tab at the top of the
repository to:

- Ask questions youâ€™re wondering about.
- Share ideas.
- Engage with other community members.

Feel free. But, please don't spam :p.

### Keep in Mind

1. Your contributions need not necessarily have to address any discovered issue. If you encounter
any, feel free to add a fix through a PR, or create a new issue ticket.

2. Use [labels](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/labels) on your issues and PRs.

3. Do not spam with lots of PRs with little changes.

4. If you are addressing a bulk change, divide your commits across multiple PRs, and send them one
at a time. The fewer the number of files addressed per PR, the better.

5. Communicate effectively. Go straight to the point. You don't need to address anyone using
'_sir_'. Don't write unnecessary comments; don't be over-apologetic. There is no superiority
hierarchy. Every single contribution is welcome, as long as it doesn't spam or distract the flow.

6. Write useful, brief commit messages. Add commit descriptions if necessary. PR name should speak
about what it is addressing and not the issue. In case a PR fixes an issue, use `fixes #ticketno` or
`closes #ticketno` in the PR's comment. Briefly explain what your PR is doing.

7. Always test your changes extensively before creating a PR. There's no sense in merging broken
code. If a PR is a _work in progress (WIP)_, convert it to draft. It'll let the maintainers know it
isn't ready for merging.

8. Read and revise the concepts about programming constructs you're dealing with. You must be clear
about the behavior of the language or compiler/transpiler. See
[JavaScript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and
[TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

9. If you have a question, do a _web search_ first. If you don't find any satisfactory answer, then
ask it in a comment. If it is a general question about Music Blocks, please use the new
[discussions](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/discussions) tab on top the the repository,
or the _Sugar-dev Devel <[sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org](mailto:sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org)>_
mailing list. Don't ask silly questions (unless you don't know it is silly ;p) before searching it
on the web.

_Please note there is no need to ask permission to work on an issue. You should check for pull
requests linked to an issue you are addressing; if there are none, then assume nobody has done
anything. Begin to fix the problem, test, make your commits, push your commits, then make a pull
request. Mention an issue number in the pull request, but not the commit message. These practices
allow the competition of ideas (Sugar Labs is a meritocracy)._
